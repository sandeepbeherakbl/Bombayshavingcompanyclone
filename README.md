# Bombayshavingcompanyclone
In the course of the second unit here at Masai School, we learned HTML and CSS along with JS DOM, Constructor functions, Prototype and Inheritance, the usage of local storage and client Server Model, Asynchronous Programming, and Promises.

At the end of our second unit, we were given a project as a part of our curriculum. We are assigned a website to clone as a construct week project. In this project we have to use all the skills we have learned till now. I had to clone https://bombayshavingcompany.com/

In this blog, I will take you through the journey me and my teammates had whilst the website cloning process.

What really is the functionality of the Bombay shaving company website?

This website is basically a eCommerce website which have lot of products related to men grooming & shaving. In our clone, we have tried to cover all the important functionalities and pages one would find over there. We use a technology stack containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Basically Bombay Shaving Company is an eCommerce web site. Which has a lots of option for men grooving and shaving products. As I have to clone this site alone it took me lot of time to frame the things I have to do. How to design the site? what all elements will present in it? what all functionality I will show in this site?

I tried to implement a workflow where the user could do the following things:
1. Landing page
2. Login Page.
3. Product Page.
4. Cart Page
5. Payment Page

THANK YOU.
